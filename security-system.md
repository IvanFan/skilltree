There are 5 capability streams we need to take care of:

1. Defensive Network
2. Application Compliance
3. Auth & Access control
4. Event management
5. Data Protection

For each stream, there are 4 levels:

Security Framework

|  | Security policy and standard | Risk management | ISMS | GRC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
|  | level 1 | level 2 | level 3 | level 4 |
| Defensive Network | Next generation firewall | content security | network sandbox | Application security |
| Endpoint & application compliance | Next generation antivirus | patch and vulnerability management | secure operation environment | Secure Devops |
| auth and access control | multi-factor auth | identity based networking | privileged account management | identity access management and single sing on |
| event management | log aggregation | SIEM | Security analysis | Security orchestration |
| data protection | transfer and recovery | Encryption and Data anonymization | Data Loss Prevention | User and Data analysis |

Tips:

Next generation firewall and web application firewall:

Next generation firewall has all features of the existing firewalls and also contains other features like IPS, DPI \(Deep packet inspection\), ssl/ssh, anti virus and etc

web application firewall: designed for web server including http/https and it focus on the application layer by checking the request data and business logic rule

**Some recommended solutions:**

Next generation firewall & IPS （Intrusion prevent system）

Web security solution

web application firewall

next generation anti-virus

formal vulnerability management program

secure operating environment \(SOE\)

multi-factor auth

log aggregation and SIEM \(Security incident and event management\)

secure file transfer
