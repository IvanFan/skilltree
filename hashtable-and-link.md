# Hashtable and Link

# 

link architecture:

head =&gt; node =&gt; node =&gt; node =&gt; tail

hastable:

key =&gt; value

key =&gt; value

key =&gt; value

Obviously, these two data structures have sth in common.

The hashtable can become a link

e.g.

hashtable\[node1\] =&gt; node1

node1.next =&gt; node2

hashtable\[node2\] =&gt;  node2
