## mutable & immutable

string tuple and number are immutable and list dict set are mutable

It means that when passing immutable attributes in to functions, system will pass a copy with a new address

But if it's a mutable attribute, the address is the same. If we assign new value to the mutable attribute, it will pass a new address.

After than the change for this attribute within the function does not affect the outside attribute. Because the address has been changed
