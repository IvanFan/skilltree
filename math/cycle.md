# Cycle

Endless cycle can be easily detected by a simple algorithm or a hash table

# example:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 \(where it will stay\), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

```py
def isHappy(self, n):
    mem = set()
    while n != 1:
        n = sum([int(i) ** 2 for i in str(n)])
        if n in mem:
            return False
        else:
            mem.add(n)
    else:
        return True
```
