Above is a simple solution, sort the elements directly which has nlogn complex

We can also do it with heap

1. directly push everything into heap
2. while heap is not empty, get the smallest value



or we can first push the top round into the heap and if we get the smallest element, then we push the next element into the heap

Heap is used to get largest or smallest value with nLogk
