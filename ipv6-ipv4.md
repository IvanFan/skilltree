## ARP

地址解析协议\(Address Resolution Protocol\)，其基本功能为透过目标设备的IP地址，查询目标的MAC地址，以保证通信的顺利进行。它是IPv4网络层必不可少的协议，不过在IPv6中已不再适用，并被邻居发现协议（NDP）所替代。

## IPv6

Internet Protocol version 6 \(IPv6\) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol \(IP\), the communications protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4.\[1\] IPv6 became a Draft Standard in December 1998, and became an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017.\[2\]



IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038 addresses

The total number of possible IPv6 addresses is more than 7.9×1028 times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses.
